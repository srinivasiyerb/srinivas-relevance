/**
 * Description:<br>
 * The comment and rating service offers GUI elements to comment and rate OLATResourceable objects. The objects can be specified even more precise by providing an
 * optional sub path
 * <p>
 * Get an instance of this service by calling the ServiceCreatorFactory and then call the init method to initialize the service for your resource:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * //to get the service either use coreSpringFactory.getBean(CommentAndRatingService.class) or when used in a singleton manager
 * implement the CommentAndRatingServiceFactory interface and see an example using the CommentAndRatingServiceFactory as the service is
 * stateful
 * if (commentAndRatingService != null) {
 * 	// initialize the service with the resource, an optional subpath (or NULL) and the administrative flag
 * 	commentAndRatingService.init(myOlatResource, myResourceSubPath, isAdmin);
 * 	// start using the service
 * 	UserCommentsController commentsCtr = commentAndRatingService.createUserCommentsController(ureq, getWindowControl());
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <P>
 * Initial Date: 24.11.2009 <br>

Overview description of jump-in handling for external links into OLAT system.

<h3>Introduction</h3> 
Jump-in URL are used e.g. in automatic generated emails to add a direct link into OLAT system. 
Two jump-in mechanisms exist :<br>
 - A new with full-text search introduced-BusinessControl based jump-in.<br>
 - Older deprecated with olatResourceable and initialViewIdentifier based jump-in.<br>
Both mechanisms are used in OLAT, but for new implementation you should use the  
BusinessControl based jump-in.

<h3>New BusinessControl based jump-in </h3>
 Used in DropboxScoringViewController Email.<br>
 <br>
 Example JumpIn URL :<br>
 <code>http://olathost.org/olat/resource/go?resourceurl=[BusinessGroup=123456]</code><br> 
 This URL opens in OLAT-system a group-tab with group-ID=123456.
 <br>
 Background : In the fulltext search each resource must have a unique resource-url to link information from search-index to
 system-resource. E.g. a forum in a certain group must be adressed. To solve this a BusinessControl was introduced. The
 resource-url represent the nessessary clicks to navigate to a resource.<br>
 <br>
 Resource-url Format :<br>
 <code>[RESOURCE_TYPE_1:RESOURCE_ID_1][RESOURCE_TYPE_2:RESOURCE_ID_2][...</code><br>
 <br>
 Entry-point to resolve jump-in url : NewControllerFactory. The NewControllerFactory resolve the first entry in the resource-url.
 Now this could be a business-group or a repository-entry. The appropriate element is loaded and a launch-controller will be created.
 The next part of the resource-url will be resolved by the child element.

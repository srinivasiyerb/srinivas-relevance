/**
 * Description:<br>
 * A fileTransaction is a unit of work which can be committed or rolled back. <br>
 * the work can consist of<br>
 * a) creating directories and putting files and subdirectories in it.<br>
 * or <br>
 * b) deleting directories (including recursively deleting subfiles and directories)<br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Note: only directories that did not exist "in reality" can be rolled back, that is, only the creation of new directories is rollbackable, not the adding of new files
 * to existing directories.
 * <P>
 * Initial Date: 09.11.2007 <br>

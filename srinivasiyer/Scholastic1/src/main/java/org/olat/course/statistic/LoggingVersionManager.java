/**
 * Simple o_property setter and getter class to manage logging versions.
 * <p>
 * The idea is to set a tuple <version,startingTimeMillis> in the o_property table once a breaking change in the logging system happens, rendering data in the
 * o_loggingversion prior to startingTimeMillis unusable for statistics. Or at least, older data needs to be treated the old way and newer data a new way.
 * <p>
 * This is to prevent having to add a version column to the o_loggingtable for the sole purpose of this infrequent version change.

/**
 * Description:<br>
 * cluster:: this is work in progress
 * 
 * @deprecated work in progress a helper to organize files. a FileTransaction is essentially a file system directory without the user knowing the absolute path. <br>
 * <br>
 *             a FileTransaction is a unit of work (as a db transaction) that can either be committed or rolled back. this is a very very simple form of a transactional
 *             filesystem. <br>
 * <br>
 *             a FileTransaction does however -not- provide<br>
 *             - a locking utility<br>
 *             - quota management <br>
 *             - a vfs (virtual file system)<br>
 *             - synchronizing access to files and directories
 *             <P>
 *             Initial Date: 09.11.2007 <br>
